# Credit Card Fraud wiht Logistic Regression

Using a kaggle dataset a LR model was created to predict wheter a transaction was fraudulent or legit. As it can be seen, most of the code involves the pre-processing of the data and modifying it to fit our model. Unfortunately, there was a large disparity between the number of legit and fraudulent data (0 or 1) because of this our sample size for legit was decreased to be as big as the fraudulent size. Eventhough, the accuracy was high it is my believe that more data is needed to train this model.
